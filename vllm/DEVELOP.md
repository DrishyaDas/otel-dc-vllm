```

3) Build with Gradle
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
*Note: gradle 7.4 will be installed if you do not have it.*

## Run ODCL

1) Make sure code is built with Java SDK 11+.

2) Refine configuration file (config/config.yaml) according to your own vLLM application. 

3) Start up your OTLP backend which accept OTLP connections. 

1) Option-1: Run the Data Collector with gradle
```bash
./gradlew run
```
1) Option-2: Extract deployment package generated by gradle:
